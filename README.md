Indprojekt-2

The project is built on html, css and javascript. 
The website is made so that you can check bus times/train times by an API checking and then sending it out to the website, 
there is also a weather and a best books list part that also takes its information from the API's. 
The second part selects the schedule that is for that day from a google calendar.

So the main part is the use of API's and how they work.
